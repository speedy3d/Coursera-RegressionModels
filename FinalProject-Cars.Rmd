##Executive Summary

Fuel efficienty and transmission type are both very important and greatly debated factors when selecting a new car.

##Exploring the Data



```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
